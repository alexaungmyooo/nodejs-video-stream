# HTTP Video Streaming Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to set up a basic HTTP video streaming server using Node.js and Express. The server streams video content in chunks, allowing efficient delivery and playback of large video files.

## Overview

The server is designed to handle video streaming using HTTP partial content delivery, which is especially useful for large video files. This method enhances user experience by allowing viewers to seek through the video without needing to download the entire file.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system
- [npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- Basic understanding of Node.js and Express.
- A video file for streaming (e.g., bigbuck.mp4).

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set Up Project

Create a new directory for your project and initialize a Node.js application:

```bash
mkdir video-streaming
cd video-streaming
yarn init -y
```

### Step 2: Create Server

In the project, create a file named `index.js`. This file will set up an Express server that handles requests for the video stream and serves an HTML page for the frontend.

### Step 3: Create HTML Frontend

Create an `index.html` file in your project directory. This file will be served by the Express server and will include the HTML code for your video player.

### Step 4: Run the Server

After placing your video file in the project directory, start the server. You can then navigate to the local server URL in your web browser to access the video stream.

```bah
yarn start
```

## Conclusion

This tutorial provides a basic setup for streaming video content using HTTP range requests in Node.js. This approach is suitable for personal projects and learning purposes. For production environments, consider using dedicated streaming services or protocols like HLS or DASH for better performance and compatibility.
